COMPILING NOTES
===============

The gui/ directory contains the C++ code.

OBLIGE uses makefiles for building:

-  Makefile.local for the Linux binary (local files)
-  Makefile.xming for the Win32 EXE
-  Makefile.unixy for a system-wide Linux install

These makefiles require GNU Make.

I personally compile the Win32 binaries on Linux using what's
called a "Cross Compiler".  The Ubuntu package is "mingw32".
That means I don't need to reboot out of Linux in order to
compile Win32 binaries.  Plus compiling stuff in Windows
always seems to be a major pain in the arse.

Sorry, but if you want to compile the Win32 binary under
Windows then you are on your own.

For a system-wide installation (with Makefile.unixy) you need
to run "make install" as the superuser after building.  Users
can override script and data files by placing a file with the
same name (e.g. "games/doom.lua") in their $HOME/.oblige/ dir.


REQUIRED LIBRARIES
==================

Zlib (v1.2.3 or later)
  http://www.gzip.org/zlib

FLTK (Fast Light Tool Kit) : v1.1.10
  http://www.fltk.org/

FLTK may require: libpng, jpeglib, zlib
  http://libpng.org/
  http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg/index.html


FLTK BUILDING HINTS
===================

(1) Linux: ./configure --quiet --disable-shared --disable-gl \
           --disable-localjpeg --disable-localzlib --disable-localpng

(2) Win32 cross-compile:
    (a) copy makefiles/Makefile.mingw --> ./Makefile
    (b) copy makefiles/makeinclude.mingw --> ./makeinclude
    (c) copy makefiles/config.mingw --> ./config.h

    (d) in makeinclude: add 'i586-mingw32msvc-' prefix to
        gcc, g++, ar and ranlib.
    (e) in makeinclude: use '-ruv' instead of 'cr' for ar command.
    (f) in makeinclude: remove $(IMAGELIBS) from LINKFLTKIMG line.
    (g) in makeinclude: comment out .SILENT directive.
    (h) in makeinclude: remove -fno-exceptions

    (i) in config.h: set HAVE_GL and HAVE_GL_GLU to 0.
        comment out HAVE_LIBPNG, HAVE_LIBJPEG, HAVE_LIBZ.
        comment out HAVE_LONG_LONG.

    (j) in Makefile: remove the 'makeinclude' and 'configure' targets.
    (k) in Makefile: remove $(IMAGEDIRS) and 'fluid' from DIRS variable.
