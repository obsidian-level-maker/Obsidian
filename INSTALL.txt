COMPILING NOTES
===============

The gui/ directory contains the C++ code.

OBLIGE uses makefiles for building:

-  Makefile       : for a system-wide Linux install
-  Makefile.xming : for the Win32 EXE

These makefiles require GNU Make.

I personally compile the Win32 binaries on Linux using what's
called a "Cross Compiler".  The Ubuntu package is "mingw32".
That means I don't need to reboot out of Linux in order to
compile Win32 binaries.  Plus compiling stuff in Windows
always seems to be a major pain in the arse.

Sorry, but if you want to compile the Win32 binary under
Windows then you are on your own.

For a system-wide Linux installation you should run "make install"
as root (the superuser) after building, which installs all the
script and data files.


REQUIRED LIBRARIES
==================

Zlib (v1.2.3 or later)
  http://www.zlib.net/

FLTK (Fast Light Tool Kit) : v1.3
  http://www.fltk.org/

FLTK may require: libpng, jpeglib, zlib
  http://libpng.org/

FLTK BUILDING HINTS
===================

WIN32 cross-compile:
    (a) read README.CMake.txt and copy the cross-compiling snippet
        in there to a file: Toolchain-mingw32.cmake

    (b) edit Toolchain-mingw32.cmake and set the proper paths for
        the cross-compiling tools (for me: i586-mingw32msvc)

    (c) mkdir mingw ; cd mingw

    (d) cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-mingw32.cmake \
        CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOPTION_USE_GL=OFF -DOPTION_USE_THREADS=OFF

    (e) make

    Note that the build fails when it gets to some stuff which require
    FLUID to process some .fl files.  That doesn't matter since the
    needed libraries (in mingw/lib) have been built by then.
