COMPILING Oblige
================

Dependencies
------------

1. C++ compiler (GNU's G++) and associated tools
   packages: g++ binutils

2. GNU make
   package: make

3. FLTK 1.3 
   website: http://www.fltk.org/
   package: libfltk1.3-dev

   You may also need: libxft-dev
                      libxinerama-dev
                      libjpeg-dev
                      libpng-dev

4. zlib
   website: http://www.zlib.net/
   package: zlib1g-dev

5. XDG Utils
   (only needed for Linux, to install the desktop and icon files)
   package: xdg-utils


Linux Compilation
-----------------

Assuming all those dependencies are met, then the following shell
command will build the Eureka binary. (The '>' is just the prompt)

   > make


Windows Compilation
-------------------

I personally compile the Win32 binaries on Linux using what's
called a "Cross Compiler".  That means I don't need to reboot
out of Linux in order to create the Win32 packages.

Sorry, but if you want to compile the Win32 binary under
Windows itself then you are on your own.

Assuming you have a working cross-compiler, like the "mingw32"
package in Debian or Ubuntu Linux, then the following command
will build the EXE:

   > make -f Makefile.xming



INSTALLING Oblige
=================

For a system-wide Linux installation you should run "make install"
as root (the superuser) after building, which installs the binary
program plus all the script and data files.  It also uses the XDG
tools to install a desktop file and icon, allowing Oblige to appear
in your system's applications menu -- though if this step fails,
Oblige will still work when invoked from the command line.



MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
===================

To build FLTK with the WIN32 cross-compiler:

  (a) read README.CMake.txt and copy the cross-compiling snippet
      in there to a file: Toolchain-mingw32.cmake

  (b) edit Toolchain-mingw32.cmake and set the proper paths for
      the cross-compiling tools (for me: i586-mingw32msvc)

  (c) mkdir mingw ; cd mingw

  (d) cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-mingw32.cmake \
      CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOPTION_USE_GL=OFF -DOPTION_USE_THREADS=OFF

  (e) make

Note that the build fails when it gets to some stuff which require
FLUID to process some .fl files.  That doesn't matter since the
needed libraries (in mingw/lib) have been built by then.
