		<H1>About ZDBSP</H1>
		<P>ZDBSP is a stand-alone version of ZDoom's internal node builder. This node 
			builder was written with two design goals in mind:</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			It must be fast. The original node builder was just going to be used to fix map 
			errors in ZDoom. After adding GL nodes support, ZDoomGL also started using it 
			as a preprocessing step for any maps without existing GL nodes.&nbsp;In both 
			cases,&nbsp;the node builder&nbsp;needed to be quick in order to minimize the 
			time the user was forced to wait before playing a map.
			<LI>
				Polyobject bleeding must be minimized. The node builder was tested with the 
				standard Hexen maps and several user maps, and it has been able to prevent 
				bleeding on all properly-formed maps. (Note that it is impossible to prevent 
				polyobject bleeding in all circumstances. See the polyobjects section below for 
				rules you should follow for best results.)</LI></OL>

		<H1>Using ZDBSP with WadAuthor</H1>
		<P>First, copy zdbsp.exe to your WadAuthor directory. Then start WadAuthor and 
			choose "Options..." from its Tools menu. Select the "Files" tab and&nbsp;choose 
			"External" for Node Building. This activates the Command text box so that you 
			can type text into it. Copy and paste any of the following into it based on 
			what you want to do.</P>
		<P>Create a map that can be played with Doom or any source port:</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<P>zdbsp -R -m$_Mapname $_Wadfile -o$_Wadfile</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P dir="ltr">Create a map that will only be played with ZDoom. This will be 
			ZDoom-only because it creates a zero-length REJECT lump. ZDoom is smart enough 
			to know that a zero-length REJECT lump is the same thing as a REJECT lump 
			filled with zeros, so you can save space:</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<P dir="ltr">zdbsp -r -m$_Mapname $_Wadfile -o$_Wadfile</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P dir="ltr">Create a map with both regular and GL nodes so that ZDoomGL does not

		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<H1 dir="ltr">ZDBSP command line options</H1>
		<P dir="ltr">ZDBSP supports several command line options to affect its behavior. If 
			you forget what they are, you can view a quick summary of them by running ZDBSP 
			without any options. They are also listed below in more detail than the listing 
			ZDBSP provides. Note that these options are case-sensitive, so -r is not the 
			same thing as -R. You can use either the long form of an option or the short 
			form depending on your preference.</P>
		<dl>
			<dt>--help</dt>
			<dd>
				Displays a summary of all ZDBSP's command line options, as if you had run ZDBSP 
				without any options.</dd>
			<dt>--version or -V</dt>
			<dd>
				Displays ZDBSP's version number.</dd>
			<dt>--map=<i>MAP</i> or -m<i>MAP</i></dt>
			<dd>
				When you use this option, ZDBSP will only build the nodes for one map in a wad 
				instead of rebuilding the nodes for every map contained in the wad. <i>MAP</i> should 
				be the map's full name (e.g. MAP01 or E1M1)</dd>
			<dt>--output=<i>FILE</i> or -o<i>FILE</i></dt>
			<dd>
				Normally, ZDBSP creates a new wad named tmp.wad. You can use this option to 
				make it write to a different file instead. In the case of WadAuthor, this is 
				used to make ZDBSP overwrite the original file with the new one, because that 
				is what WadAuthor expects the nodebuilder to do.</dd>
			<dt>--no-prune or -q</dt>
			<dd>
				When you use this option, ZDBSP will not remove unused sidedefs or sectors from 
				a map. ZDBSP will always remove 0-length linedefs from a map even when you use 
				this option because it is possible for them to make the game crash under 
				certain circumstances. Moreover, ZDoom will itself remove 0-length linedefs and 
				rebuild the nodes if it finds any.</dd>
			<dt>--no-nodes or -N</dt>
			<dd>
				This option causes ZDBSP to take the node information from the old wad file and 
				write it to the new wad file. I can't think of any reason why you would want to 
				do this, but it is provided as an option nonetheless.</dd>
			<dt>--gl or -g</dt>
			<dd>
				This option causes ZDBSP to build two sets of nodes for a map: One set of 
				regular nodes and one set of GL nodes. Because ZDBSP is doing twice the work, 
				it will take twice as long to finish.</dd>
			<dt>--gl-matching or -G</dt>
			<dd>
				Like the previous option, this one will also make ZDBSP generate GL nodes. 
				However, it will only build one set of nodes and then strip the extra GL 
				information from them to create the normal nodes. Because of this, it is faster 
				than the previous option when you want to create GL nodes, but the normal nodes 
				will generally be less efficient because they were created from the GL nodes.</dd>
			<dt>--gl-v5 org -5</dt>
			<dd>
				Always write GL nodes using the v5 GL node specification. Normally, v5 GL nodes
				are only written if they exceed the limits of v2 GL nodes. Since v2 GL nodes are
				more widely supported than v5 GL nodes and v5 GL nodes are only useful for very
				large maps, you should generally not use this option. If you do not specify this
				option, v5 GL nodes will still be automatically written if they are required, and
				if they are not, the more space-efficient v2 GL nodes will be created instead.
			</dd>
			<dt>--compress or -z</dt>
			<dd>Compresses the node information. Compressed nodes take up less space than
			uncompressed nodes, they are the only way to save nodes with more than 65535 segs, and
			they also have higher vertex precision than normal nodes, reducing the possibility
			of slime trails. If GL nodes are built, they will be compressed as well.</dd>
			<dt>--compress-normal or -Z</dt>
			<dd>This is exactly like the previous option, except GL nodes will not be compressed.</dd>
			<dt>--extended or -X</dt>
			<dd>Creates extended nodes. This is exactly like --compress, except the resultant nodes
			are uncompressed.</dd>
			<dt>--empty-blockmap or -b</dt>
			<dd>
				This option writes a zero-length BLOCKMAP to the wad. As of this writing, ZDoom 
				is the only port that will detect this and build the BLOCKMAP itself.</dd>
			<dt>--empty-reject or -r</dt>
			<dd>
				When this option is used, ZDBSP will write a zero-length REJECT to the wad. As 
				of this writing, ZDoom is the only port that supports this. A zero-length 
				REJECT is the same thing as a reject filled with zeros. Since ZDBSP does not 
				generate a REJECT table, and the usefulness of having a REJECT is questionable, 
				you should always use this option if you intend for the map to be played solely 
				with ZDoom.</dd>
			<dt>--zero-reject or -R</dt>
			<dd>
				This option is similar to the previous one, except ZDBSP will actually write 
				out a full-sized REJECT lump filled with zeros. If you play with ZDoom, this is 
				just wasted space, but other ports and Doom itself require a full-sized REJECT 
				lump to work.</dd>
			<dt>--no-reject or -E</dt>
			<dd>
				This option makes ZDBSP copy the REJECT lump from the old wad to the new wad 
				unchanged. However, if it detects that the old REJECT is the wrong size for the 
				number of sectors in the map, it will be removed as if you had used the 
				--empty-reject option.</dd>
			<dt>--no-polyobjs or -P</dt>
			<dd>
				This option disables ZDBSP's polyobject detection code. If you are building 
				nodes for a map without polyobjects, you might be able to save a fraction of a 
				second from the build time by using this option, but there is generally no 
				reason to use it.</dd>
			<dt>--no-timing or -t</dt>
			<dd>
				If you don't care how long it takes to build nodes, use this option and ZDBSP 
				won't tell you.</dd>
			<dt>--no-sse</dt>
			<dd>Disables all SSE optimizations in the nodebuilder, which can be useful if you just
				want to measure the kind of speed up SSE or SSE2 provides.</dd>
			<dt>--no-sse2</dt>
			<dd>Disables all SSE2 optimizations in the nodebuilder. SSE1 will still be used if
				your processor supports it. Unless you want to compare the speed difference
				between SSE and SSE2, there is again little reason to use this option.</dd>
			<dt>--warn or -w</dt>
			<dd>
				Displays extra warning messages that ZDBSP might generate while building GL 
				nodes. The nodes will still be usable if warnings occur, and warnings are not 
				unlikely. If you have strange display problems with GL nodes, turning on the 
				warning messages may help you locate the problem.</dd>
			<dt>--partition=<i>NNN</i> or -p<i>NNN</i></dt>
			<dd>
				This option controls the maximum number of segs that will be considered for 
				splitters at each node. The default is 64. By increasing it, you might be able 
				to generate "better" nodes, but you get diminishing returns the higher you make 
				it. High values are also slower than low ones.</dd>
			<dt>--split-cost=<i>NNN</i> or -s<i>NNN</i></dt>
			<dd>
				This option adjusts how hard ZDBSP tries to avoid splitting segs. The default 
				value is 8. By increasing this, ZDBSP will try harder to avoid splitting segs. 
				If you decrease it, ZDBSP will split segs more frequently. More splits mean the 
				BSP tree will usually be more balanced, but it will also take up more room.</dd>
			<dt>--diagonal-cost=<i>NNN</i> or -d<i>NNN</i></dt>
			<dd>
				This option controls how hard ZDBSP tries to avoid using diagonal splitters. 
				The default value is 16. A higher value means that diagonal splitters will be 
				more likely to be used. This can sometimes help to reduce the number of segs in 
				a map. The reason avoiding diagonal splitters is important is because normal 
				nodes do not store any fractional information for the vertices that segs use, 
				so you are more likely to see slime trails with diagonal splitters than with 
				horizontal or vertical splitters.</dd>
			<dt>--view or -v</dt>
			<dd>
				Under Windows, this displays a viewer that will let you inspect a map's 
				subsectors, nodes, and REJECT. To scroll the map around, drag it with your 
				right mouse button. The viewer was created to assist with debugging with the GL 
				nodes. It is not very user-friendly nor is it bug-free. In fact, if you try to 
				build nodes for more than one map with this option, there is a good chance 
				ZDBSP will crash.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h1>Polyobjects</h1>
		<p>One of ZDBSP's most important features is that it tries very hard to avoid 
			polyobject bleeding. To make this feature work, however, you must design your 
			maps properly. You do this be ensuring that your polyobjects are always shown 
			inside a <i>convex</i> sector. This is referring to the area where the 
			polyobjects appear in the game, not where they appear in an editor. If you do 
			not know what convex means, think of triangles, squares and circles. They are 
			all convex. If you have a sector shaped like the letter C, that is not convex.</p>
		<p>Ironically, an example of what <i>not</i> to do is in Hexen's MAP01. The 
			polyobject doors at the very start of that map do not appear in a convex area. 
			ZDBSP has been tuned so that they will display properly with the default 
			options, but you should not count on this for your own maps.</p>
		<p>If ZDBSP has to split a linedef around a polyobject's display area, it will 
			print a message indicating where this happened so that you can inspect the area 
			and fix it. For example, when you use ZDBSP on hexen.wad, it outputs these 
			warnings for MAP01:</p>
		<pre class="code">   Split seg 929 (-1176,1312)-(-1088,1312) of sector 265 on line 572
   Split seg 931 (-1088,1312)-(-1000,1312) of sector 265 on line 573</pre>
		<p>The important pieces of information here are the coordinates of the segs that 
			were split and the lines those segs were made from. In this case, both lines 
			572 and 573 were split. Because they surround a polyobject's display area, 
			ideally they should not be split, so you need to look at the map in an editor 
			to determine what made them split. This happens because the area is not convex, 
			so you need to look for a line in the same "loop" that, if you made it longer, 
			could cross the line that was split. In this example, lines 575 and 579 are 
			responsible for splitting line 572, and lines 576 and 578 are responsible for 
			splitting line 573. You can fix the error by reworking the area so that it is 
			convex, either by moving lines 575, 579, 576, and 578, or by adding additional 
			lines to separate each half into four convex pieces.
		</p>
		<p>Below are some illustrations. The areas where the two polyobjects appear have 
			been highlighted.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="center">This first image shows the area as it appears in hexen.wad, 
				unmodified. Note that neither side is convex, so ZDBSP will need to split each 
				side into two subsectors. The extra subsectors have been highlighted in a 
				brighter color to illustrate how ZDBSP splits them.<br />
				<img src="poly_bad.png" alt="The Original Area"></p>
			<p align="center">In the next image, the lines have been moved to make each side 
				convex.<br />
				<img src="poly_mov.png" alt="Convex Areas made by Moving Lines">
			</p>
			<p align="center">In the final image, new two-sided lines have been added to make 
				each polyobject's display area rectangular. Unlike the line-moving method 
				above, this does not alter the area's appearance. Notice that this looks a lot 
				like the way ZDBSP split them in the first image. The difference is that by 
				adding the extra lines yourself, you have control over how the split is done 
				and ZDBSP does not need to guess about the best way to make the area convex.<br />
				<img src="poly_new.png" alt="Convex Areas made by Adding Lines"></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Unfortunately, if you use WadAuthor, ZDBSP's output window will not normally 
			appear long enough for you to actually read it. You can get around this by 
			adding the -v option to the zdbsp command line that WadAuthor uses (see the 
			Using ZDBSP with WadAuthor section). Then its output will stay around until you 
			close the ZDBSP viewer.</p>
		<h1>Compressed Nodes</h1>
		<p>The following information describes the format used to store compressed nodes. 
			If you are just a regular user, you can skip this section.</p>
		<p>Compressed nodes contain all the same information as regular nodes but are 
			stored in a single lump and compressed as a zlib data stream. They also support 
			more than 65535 segs and vertices by storing them using four bytes instead of 
			two.</p>
		<p>The first four bytes of the compressed nodes are a four-character (uncompressed) 
			signature. This can be either 'ZNOD' for regular nodes or 'ZGLN' for GL nodes.
			If there are more than 65534 lines in the map, the signature 'ZGL2' is used
			for GL nodes instead. (Note that this can only happen with UDMF maps, because
			the binary map format does not allow more lines than that.) There is also a third
			variant of 'ZGLN': 'ZGL3' is identical to 'ZGL2' but expands the node's splitter
			field to fixed point coordinates.
			Following the signature is the zlib data stream. For a description of its 
			format, see the zlib documentation. When you decompress it, the following 
			information is obtained in this order:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Vertex information</li>
			<li>
				Subsector information</li>
			<li>
				Segs information</li>
			<li>
				Nodes information</li></ol>
		<h2>Types</h2>
		<p>The following sections use these types:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><b>BYTE</b></dt><dd>A single unsigned byte. The number can be in the range [0, 
				255].</dd>
			<dt><b>WORD</b></dt><dd>An unsigned integer stored in two bytes. The number can be 
				in the range [0, 65535].</dd>
			<dt><b>SWORD</b></dt><dd>A signed integer stored in two bytes. The number can be
				in the range [-32768, 32767].</dd>
			<dt><b>DWORD</b></dt><dd>An unsigned integer stored in four bytes. The number can 
				be in the range [0, 4294967295].</dd>
			<dt><b>FIXED</b></dt><dd>A signed 16.16 fixed-point number stored in four bytes. The 
				most-significant two bytes store the integer part of the number, and the 
				least-significant two bytes store the fractional part of the number. The number can 
				be in the approximate range [-32768.99998, 32767.99998].</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>All multi-byte numbers are stored with their least significant byte first (i.e. 
			little-endian).</p>
		<h2>Vertex information</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>DWORD</td>
				<td><i>OrgVerts</i></td>
				<td>Number of vertices used from the VERTEXES lump</td>

			<tr>
				<td>FIXED</td>
				<td><i>Y</i></td>
				<td>Y-Coordinate</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>These are all the <i>additional</i> vertices that the segs use. Unlike normal 
			nodes, extra vertices are not added to the VERTEXES lump. When determining 
			which vertex <i>v</i> a seg uses, if <i>v</i> < <i>OrgVerts</i>, then <i>v</i> is 
			a vertex in the VERTEXES lump. Otherwise, when <i>v</i> >= <i>OrgVerts</i>, <i>v</i>
			- <i>OrgVerts</i> is the index of a vertex stored here.</p>
		<p>Like version 2 GL nodes, the vertices stored here are represented as 16.16 fixed 
			point numbers in order to maintain the full precision of the Doom engine.</p>
		<h2>Subsector information</h2>

			<tr>
				<td>DWORD</td>
				<td>NumSegs</td>
				<td>Number of segs for this subsector</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Unlike normal nodes, the first seg in each subsector is not stored. This can be 
			inferred by the ordering of the subsectors. The first subsector always starts 
			at seg 0, and each following subsector begins with the seg immediately after 
			the previous subsector's last seg.</p>
		<h2>Segs information</h2>
		<p>The specific layout for this section depends on whether the data stream 
			represents normal nodes or GL nodes. In each case, the segs are stored in an 11 
			byte structure, but their contents differ slightly. <i>There is no padding to make 
				these align to DWORD boundaries.</i>

        </table>
        <p>Unlike standard GL nodes, each seg's second vertex is not stored. This is 
			because GL subsectors must form a closed area. In other words, one seg's second 
			vertex is the same as the next seg's first vertex. The subsector information 
			contains everything you need to know to close each area and start a new one.</p>
		<p>Example: Suppose you have not read any segs yet, and the first subsector has 
			four segs. Therefore, the second vertex for the first four segs can be 
			determined to be:</p>
		<blockquote><table>
				<tr>
					<td>Seg 0</td>
					<td>Second vertex is Seg 1's first vertex</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Seg 1</td>
					<td>Second vertex is Seg 2's first vertex</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Seg 2</td>
					<td>Second vertex is Seg 3's first vertex</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Seg 3</td>
					<td>Second vertex is Seg 0's first vertex (because this is the last seg in the 
						subsector)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So for each subsector, all but the last seg's second vertex will be the same as 
			the next seg's first vertex. The last seg's second vertex will be the same as 
			the first seg's first vertex.</p>

		<p>As with standard nodes, a child's high bit is set to indicate that it is a 
			subsector and cleared to indicate that it is another node. Just remember that 
			the child references are stored using four bytes each instead of two.</p>
		<h2>Compressed node storage</h2>
		<p>Normal nodes (signature 'ZNOD') are stored in a map's NODES lump. Bear in mind 
			that compressed nodes are contained entirely within a single lump rather than 
			in three separate lumps.</p>
		<p>GL nodes (signature 'ZGLN') are stored in a map's SSECTORS lump. Unlike regular 
			GL nodes, no new lumps are created for compressed GL nodes.</p>
		<p>The SEGS lump is left unused and should be written with a length of 0. I may 
			find some way to "hijack" this lump in the future, so programs that read 
			compressed nodes must not assume that if the SEGS lump is non-empty, then 
			compressed nodes are not used.</p>
		<p>For UDMF maps, nodes a stored in the map's ZNODES lump. These will only be
		    'ZGLN' or 'ZGL2' format nodes. Non-GL nodes are not supported for UDMF.</p>
		<h2>Extended nodes</h2>
		<p>For the benefit of ports not wishing to support zlib decompression of nodes,
		   there are variants of the compressed node formats without compression. These
		   are referred to extended nodes, and differ only from their compressed counterparts
		   in that their contents are not compressed. They use a different signature to
		   distinguish them from compressed nodes:</p>
		<ul><li>ZNOD -> XNOD</li>
		<li>ZGLN -> XGLN</li>
		<li>ZGL2 -> XGL2</li>
		<li>ZGL3 -> XGL3</li></ul>
