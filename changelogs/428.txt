CHANGES (since 3.57)
====================

* V4 began as an experiment into a completely new way to layout rooms
  using prefabs for everything including floors and ceilings.  However
  this system proved to be unsatisfactory (not flexible enough), so I
  scrapped it and went back to the drawing board.
