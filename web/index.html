<h1>OBLIGE Level Maker</h1>

by Andrew Apted. &nbsp; June 2008


<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

OBLIGE is a random level maker for the following games:
DOOM&nbsp;1, DOOM&nbsp;2, Final&nbsp;DOOM, FreeDOOM,
Wolfenstein-3D, Heretic&nbsp;1 and Hexen&nbsp;1.
These games all share the same basic level structure
(except for Wolf3d which is much more limited).

<p>
OBLIGE will have the following features which set it apart
from existing programs (like the famous
<a href="http://www.doomworld.com/slige/">SLIGE</a> by David Chess)
:-

<ul>
  <li>higher quality levels, e.g. outdoor areas!
  <li>easy to use GUI interface (no messing with command lines)
  <li>built-in node builder, so the created levels are ready to play
  <li>uses the LUA scripting language for easy customisation
  <li>can create Deathmatch levels
  <li>Heretic and Hexen support!
</ul>


<h2>NEWS</h2>

<b>30-May-2008</b>:
Released Oblige 0.97 which is a small update to 0.94.

<p>
<b>13-Mar-2008</b>:
Added a summary of recent development:
<a href="http://oblige.sourceforge.net/update.html">Devel Notes</a>

<p>
<b>5-Jul-2007</b>:
Oblige 0.94 was released.


<h2>STATUS</h2>

<p>
OBLIGE 0.97 is the current version.
The GUI interface is simple but very usable.
The battle simulator produces reasonable
ammo and health to fight the monsters in the map.

<p>
<i>See below for the status of each game</i>

<p>
There is still a lot to do however.
There is no support (yet) for the special levels, such as the
end-of-episode levels of DOOM&nbsp;1 and the end-of-game level (MAP30)
of DOOM&nbsp;2.
Other desirable features are: nicer (non-square) architecture,
player teleporters, and better lighting.

<h2>SCREENSHOTS</h2>

<h2>USAGE GUIDE</h2>

The graphical interface for OBLIGE is quite easy to use.

<p>
At the top is the <b>Settings</b> panel, which contains the most
important settings.

<p>
The first control is the "SEED" number.
Each SEED number produces a unique, distinctive level. 
Using the same SEED number always produces the exact same level
(as long as the other settings are the same).

<p>
Other settings include:
<ul>
  <li>the "Game" type (DOOM, WOLF3D, HERETIC or HEXEN), 
  <li>the "Mode" of the game (SINGLE-PLAYER, CO-OP, or DEATHMATCH)
  <li>the "Length" of the output wad (SINGLE-LEVEL, ONE-EPISODE, FULL-GAME).
</ul>

In the <b>Adjustments</b> panel you can control the size of
the created levels, as well as how much health,
ammunition and how many monsters and puzzles are added.
OBLIGE also implements the different skill levels
for each map (e.g. Hurt-me-Plenty vs Ultra-Violence).

<p>
After you've chosen the desired settings, press the "Build..." button,
which will open a Save-File dialog asking you what the output file
should be. Enter something appropriate, e.g. TEST, and after that
OBLIGE will starting building the levels.

<p>
In Wolfenstein-3D mode, the "Build..." button does not bring up
a dialog box.
OBLIGE simply creates the output files in the same folder where
it is installed. These files are called <b>GAMEMAPS.WL6</b> and
<b>MAPHEAD.WL6</b> and you need to copy them into your
Wolf3d folder (after making a backup!).

<p>
To exit, press the "Quit" button in the bottom right corner.

<p>
The levels created by OBLIGE are ready to play.  There is no
need to run the output WAD file through a node-builder program,
since OBLIGE does this automatically.

<p>
You should use a Source Port to play the levels, because the
original DOOM.EXE, DOOM2.EXE (etc..) may not cope with the
architecture which OBLIGE creates.  For example, you might
get the "Visplane Overflow" error which quits the game.


<h2>STATUS OF EACH GAME</h2>

<b>DOOM 1</b>: fairly well tested and working well.
<p>

<b>DOOM 2</b>: the most well tested game and produces the best results.
<p>

<b>HERETIC</b>: tested and working quite well, though
very lacking in different themes and scenery.
<p>

<b>HEXEN</b>: tested and works pretty well (greatly improved
since the last v0.85 release). The sequence of hubs is not
working properly yet.
<p>

<b>WOLF 3D</b>: very buggy and incomplete at the moment.
It lacks : pushwall secrets, patrolling enemies,
treasure rooms, proper episode endings, and may create
levels with too many actors or static objects.

<p>
<i>Note: 0.97 did not change any GUI front-end code (except for the version number),
hence there is no separate 0.97 source code package.
Grab the 0.94 source package to
get the GUI code, and any 0.97 package for the Lua code.
