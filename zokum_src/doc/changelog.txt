ZokumBSP 1.1 
- Yule release! Happy holidays!
- New vertex based algorithm available for testing. -na=v to use it.
- Support for two progress bars, used in vertex mode.
- Minor text output bugs, nothing too bad.

ZokumBSP 1.0.11
- Doom 25 year anniversary release.

ZokumBSP 1.0.11-rc2
- Cleanups and further speed optimizations.
- Experimental code to show tree progress, uses #define for now.

ZokumBSP 1.0.11-rc1
- Major speed optimizations in multi-tree algorithm.
- Major speed optimization in the balanced (default) algorithm.
- Fixed -nu parameter that was broken.
- Made -nu default to ON, this makes invisible floors work like expected.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-rc1
- Fixed windows text output.
- Cleaned up help screen.
- Win64 builds now available.
- WinX builds now compiled with GCC 8.2.0

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta13
- Many minor speed and memory optimizations.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta12
- Improvments to win32 console output.
- Added balanced metric for multi-tree algorithm.
- Balanced metric is now standard metric for MTA.
- New algorithm for texture offsets on segs.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta11
- Removed code that added 256 to all SEG angles for testing.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta10
- Verified fixing slime trails when using angle from segs not linedefs.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta9
- Refined wide algorith, sped it up a lot.
- Added switch to turn on colored output, now off by default.
- Added support for vertex-moving linedef types 1078 and 1079.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta8
- Wide algorithm seems to be working, but is still very slow. Only usable for
  final builds of maps. Invoke with -na=mw=2, swap out the number with how
  many sub trees you want to build.  

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta7
- New adaptive algorithm to allow for hybrid trees using depth for the big
  partitions and split reduction when segs go below a certain limit. This
  limit is tunable with -nt=?, where ? is an integer.
- Multiple split lines is still broken.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta6
- New algorithm for testing multiple split lines recursively!
- Minor tweaks to improve balanced algorithm metrics.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta5
- Added support for selecting metric for what node tree is considered best.
- Added cache to speed up multiple node rebuilds when using adaptive. This can
  in some rare cases be wrong, so use with caution.
- Added an option to make the balanced node picker aggressible pick lines that 
  cause no splits, even if they are bery unbalanced. Supported options are:
  no favoring, favor no seg splits, favor fewer subsectors, fabor both, try
  all variations.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta4
- Improved node picking algorithm. 
- Fxed a crash bug.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta3
- Fixed a problem with non-twosided walls with 2s flag on.
- Built win32 version as static, forgot that last time.
- New node build paramter s=[z,a] to toggle seg split roundoff error handling.
  s=z turns off checks, allows for faster node builds and possibly fewer segs.
  s=a avoid seg splits that lead to 'slime trails'.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta2
- Improved split reduction to favor balanced trees over unbalanced.
- Added geometry options as a separate sub type, use -g.
- Added statistics options for more output and totals, use -s.
- Various minor display fixes for the adaptive algorithm.
- Minor tweaks of the split algorithm.

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta1
- Renamed structs and methods in doom/level.* and wad.*
- Converted filenames to lower case.
- Renamed source dirs to all lower case.
- Split wadlist object into its own file, wadlist.cpp
- Added support for linedef 1080-1083 for seg bam trickery.
- Fixed nodes algorithm paramters, a=s,d,f.
- Old nodes algorithms selection now act as aliases for a=s,d,f.
- Rewrote the output, more info, xaser had the column header idea!
- Removed a bug in the split reduction algorithm, it no longer favors lines
  that are horisontal over diagonal or vertical lines with fewer splits.
- Split-reduction algorithm now favors non-diagonal lines if splits are same.
- Adaptive algorithm will not try seg thresholds above the seg count;
- Node split algorithm will favor splits near the middle if same  split count.
- Added a small summary output, adding up data from all processed maps.

ZokumBSP 1.0.9-rc2
- Turning off blockmap compression is once again possible.
- "-bi" parameter no longer claims to not use basic compression.
- Added checking of return values of memory reallocs in ZenNode.cpp
- Fixed a minor error in the va_args handling in ZenRMB.
- Fixed a mismatch new[] / delete in wad.cpp.

ZokumBSP 1.0.9-rc1
- Added geometry simplification blockmap compression. Also speeds up the
  DOOM engine due to less calculations runtime.
- Added more aggressive simplification of one sided walls in different
  sectors, set with level g=2.
- Made 00 headers default due to bad optimizations in many ports.
- Added a method to add new linedefs.
- Added trimming of linedef list to reduce unneeded linedefs.
- Linedefs with tag 998 will not be added to BSP tree, ie not rendered.
- Renamed PREPROCESS TO GEOMETRY. Added statistics, progress and run time.

ZokumBSP 1.0.8-rc2
- Using 64bit uints in reject code to stop it crashing on large maps. This
  fixed building a reject table on a 2k sector map. Bigger maps still crash
  in a different location.

ZokumBSP 1.0.8-rc1
- Anotak found a nice optimization, moved checks out of a core loop. This 
  gives a 33% speedup.

ZokumBSP 1.0.7-rc2
- Many minor cleanups of the Git repo.
- Anotak added Visual Studio tweaks to make it compile.

ZokumBSP 1.0.7-rc1
- Preprocessing is now done in a seperate step, and data can be used by reject
  and nodes structures if needed.
- New format for the changelog.txt, should be easier to read.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6 (Choose your own offset adventure)
- No changes from rc2.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6-rc2
- Added support for detecting BOOM generalized linedefs and extended linedefs.
- Limited support for a 32bit BLOCKMAP format.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6-rc1
- Use -bo=x,y to specify a specific offset, useful for special effects.
- LoadHexenInfo in level.cpp now checks if the sscanf matches anything. 

ZokumBSP 1.0.5 (Boundary box discarding)
- No changes from rc3

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc3
- Fixed several memory leaks.

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc2
- Distributed prebuilt windows version is built static. No dlls needed.

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc1
- Discards looking blocks farther away than the longest linedef in a block.

ZokumBSP 1.0.4 (Argument cleanup and a bit of heuristics)
- Added new heuristic approach to reduce brute force solution space.
- Changed command line arguments to be easier and more foolproof.

ZokumBSP 1.0.3 (Sub block improvement release)
- All non id-compatibe blockmaps are now 2 bytes smaller.
- No longer assumes 2s flag means a linedef is two-sided.

ZokumBSP 1.0.2  (Speed improvements)
- Sorted blocks allow for quicker generation / comparisons.
- Minor enhancements. Better sorting algorithm from stdlib.
- HTML output switch.
- HTML output is now usable.
- Massive speed improvements.
- Reformatted help screen.
- Fixed a ZenNode bug when an invalid wad file is specified.

ZokumBSP 1.0.1 (Released as closed source for testing)
- Compiles on windows vis MinGW.
- Id blockmap header now optional
- Support for 8x8 id offset.
- Can generate id-compatible smaller blockmaps.
- Support for tag 999 never blocking lines.
- Algorithm for finding never blocking lines.
- Option: Find sub block lists to improve blockmap size.

ZokumBSP 1.0.0 (Initial test release)
- Added brute force 128*128 origin.
